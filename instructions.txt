I wrote a detailed explanation of my thought process with markdown and LaTex
and put them in the submission.md file. I am not allowed to submit PDF or share GitHub repo,
so if you'd like to see the rendered version of it, I'd suggest Typora or Obsidian. If you don't have either of those,
you can go to https://stackedit.io/app# and paste the codes in .md in there, and it will render it for you.

All the codes are tested with `g++ 11.2.0` with the following compiler flags on 

-Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -static -Wl,--stack=268435456 -O2 -std=c++20

PS C:\Users\REDACTED\Documents> g++ --version
g++.exe (MinGW-W64 x86_64-posix-seh, built by Brecht Sanders) 11.2.0
